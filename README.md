Undergraduate Research: Working with Isaac Tian at The University of Washington Reality Lab:

Adjusting the fragment shader (last stage of the graphics pipeline) so that the color/shader accommodates spot lights (and thus area lighting) rather than point lights.

Developing Spherical Harmonic model to compare area lighting to point lighting as a ground truth

Image scraping, pipeline, and linear regressions regarding predicting body composition from 2d photography.

Development of fully connected neural networks utilizing different loss functions (MSE and cross entropy) with different architectures and hyperparameters.

Conversion of legacy VC++ code to modern vc++ and then migration to Qt cross-platform
